# Tessera Demo at the Conference on Statistical Practice 2015 #

## CSP 2015 Demo ##

### Download Demo Materials ###

The Tessera team will be presenting an interactive demo at the 
<a href="http://www.amstat.org/meetings/csp/2015/" target="_blank">
2015 Conference on Statistical Practice</a> in 
New Orleans on February 21, 2015.

Participants who would like to download the Tessera tools prior to the demo 
please follow these instructions. These tools will allow you to use and test 
Tessera in your local environment without Hadoop or a similar parallel 
processing backend.

1. If you do not already have R version 3.0.2 or later, please download and
install it here: <a href="http://cran.r-project.org" target="_blank">
http://cran.r-project.org</a>. 

2. Optional: You may find the RStudio development environment an easier way
to program in R, but it is not necessary. You may download it here:
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">http://www.rstudio.com/</a>.

3. Make sure you have Java JDK (1.4 or newer) installed. If not go here to 
install it: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">

4. Open R and execute the following commands to install the Tessera libraries:
   ```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
   install.packages("devtools") # if not already installed
   install.packages("rJava")
   library(devtools)
   install_github("tesseradata/datadr")
   install_github("tesseradata/trelliscope")
   ```
